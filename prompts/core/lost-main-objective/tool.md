When you notice your current actions feel disconnected from the original goal, follow this exact protocol step by step.

## 1. Re-state the original objective

1. Go back to the user's original request.
2. Write down the **main goal** in one or two sentences.
3. List any **explicit success criteria** the user mentioned.

Keep this statement clear and focused on what the user actually asked for.

## 2. Summarize what you have done so far

1. List the **major actions** you have taken since starting (files modified, tests written, refactoring done, etc.).
2. For each action, note whether it **directly serves** the main goal or is a **side activity**.

Format:

- Action 1: *[what you did]* — Direct / Side.
- Action 2: *[what you did]* — Direct / Side.
- …

Be honest. If an action's connection to the goal is unclear, mark it as "Side."

## 3. Identify where you drifted

1. Look at your "Side" actions from Step 2.
2. For each, ask: **Why did I do this?** Was it necessary, or did I get distracted?
3. Note the **point** where you started drifting away from the main objective.

Understanding the drift helps you avoid repeating it.

## 4. Define the next direct step

1. Based on the main goal (Step 1), identify **one concrete action** that directly advances it.
2. Make sure this action is:
   - Clearly connected to the user's request.
   - Small enough to execute immediately.
   - Verifiable (you can check if it worked).

Write it down: "Next step: *[action]*."

## 5. Refocus and execute

After you complete Steps 1–4:

1. **Stop** any side activities you were doing.
2. Execute the **next direct step** from Step 4.
3. After completing it, ask yourself: "Did this move me closer to the original goal?"
4. If yes, identify the next direct step and continue.
5. If you start drifting again, return to Step 1.
