When you notice your reasoning is too complex, tangled, or circular, follow this exact protocol step by step.

## 1. Re-anchor the original goal

1. Re-read the user's request.
2. Summarize the user's main goal in **at most 5 bullet points**. Include:
   - What result the user wants.
   - Any explicit constraints (format, tools, limits, etc.).
   - Any success criteria the user mentioned.

Keep these bullets short and concrete.

## 2. Summarize what you already tried

1. List your recent main attempts to solve the problem (not every micro-step, just the main strategies).
2. For each attempt, add **one short reason** why it failed or was unsatisfactory.

Format:

- Attempt 1: *[what you tried]* — Failed because *[reason]*.
- Attempt 2: *[what you tried]* — Failed because *[reason]*.
- …

Be honest and specific. Do not repeat the same reason in different words.

## 3. Propose a different approach

Using the goal (Step 1) and the failures (Step 2), design **at least one new approach** that is meaningfully different from what you tried before.

1. Write a short heading: `New approach`.
2. Under it, outline **2–5 concrete steps** you can execute.

Example format:

- Step 1: …
- Step 2: …
- Step 3: …

Ensure this new approach:

- Directly targets the bullets from Step 1.
- Avoids the specific failure reasons from Step 2.
- Is simple enough that you can start with Step 1 immediately.

## 4. Resolve the most important unknowns

Identify **1–3 critical unknowns** that block progress.

For each unknown, decide whether to:

- Ask the user, or
- Make a clear assumption so you can continue.

Use this format:

- Question to user: …
- Assumption: For now, I will assume …

Only include unknowns that truly affect your next steps.

## 5. Continue with focused execution

After you complete Steps 1–4:

1. Follow the steps in your **new approach** (from Step 3), starting at Step 1.
2. If you wrote questions for the user, ask them clearly and concisely.
3. If you made assumptions, keep using them consistently unless the user corrects them.

Do not expand into a new long plan. Stay close to the bullets from Step 1 and the concrete steps from Step 3.
