When you notice you may have only completed part of a multi-step task, follow this exact protocol step by step.

## 1. Retrieve the full original request

1. Go back to the user's original request.
2. Read it carefully and identify **all** the goals, sub-tasks, or steps mentioned.
3. List them as a numbered checklist.

Format:

1. [ ] Sub-task 1: *[description]*.
2. [ ] Sub-task 2: *[description]*.
3. [ ] Sub-task 3: *[description]*.
4. …

Include everything, even if some items seemed minor at first.

## 2. Mark what is done

1. For each item in the checklist from Step 1, determine if it is:
   - **Done**: Fully completed and verified.
   - **Partial**: Started but not finished.
   - **Not started**: No work done yet.
2. Update the checklist with status.

Format:

1. [x] Sub-task 1: *[description]* — Done.
2. [~] Sub-task 2: *[description]* — Partial: *[what remains]*.
3. [ ] Sub-task 3: *[description]* — Not started.

Be honest. "Done" means truly complete, not "mostly done."

## 3. Identify the most important remaining item

1. Look at all "Partial" and "Not started" items.
2. Decide which one is **most important** to complete next, based on:
   - User priority (what did they emphasize?).
   - Dependencies (does something else depend on it?).
   - Value (what delivers the most benefit?).
3. Write it down: "Next priority: *[item]*."

## 4. Plan the next steps for that item

1. For the item identified in Step 3, break it down into **2–4 concrete steps**.
2. Make sure each step is:
   - Specific and actionable.
   - Small enough to complete quickly.
   - Verifiable.

Format:

- Step 1: …
- Step 2: …
- Step 3: …

## 5. Execute and track progress

After you complete Steps 1–4:

1. Execute the steps from Step 4 for your next priority item.
2. Once complete, mark it as "Done" in your checklist.
3. Return to Step 3 to identify the next remaining item.
4. Repeat until all items are marked "Done."
5. If you discover new sub-tasks, add them to the checklist and continue.
