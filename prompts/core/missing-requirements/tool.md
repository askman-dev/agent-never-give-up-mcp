When you notice you cannot proceed due to missing or unclear requirements, follow this exact protocol step by step.

## 1. List what you know

1. Write down all requirements that **are** clear.
2. Include any constraints, formats, or limits the user mentioned.
3. Note any implicit requirements you can infer from context.

Keep this list factual and organized.

## 2. Identify what is missing

1. List the specific gaps that block your progress.
2. For each gap, explain **why** it blocks you.

Format:

- Missing: *[what you need]* — Blocks progress because *[reason]*.
- Missing: *[what you need]* — Blocks progress because *[reason]*.
- …

Prioritize: put the most critical gaps first.

## 3. Decide how to resolve each gap

For each missing requirement from Step 2, decide:

- **Ask the user**: If only the user can answer, write a clear question.
- **Make an assumption**: If you can reasonably assume, state it explicitly.
- **Use a default**: If there's a sensible default, note what it is.

Format:

- Question to user: …
- Assumption: For now, I will assume …
- Default: I will use … unless you specify otherwise.

## 4. Summarize your plan

1. List the questions you will ask the user (if any).
2. List the assumptions or defaults you will use.
3. Confirm what you can now proceed with.

Keep this summary short and actionable.

## 5. Continue with what you have

After you complete Steps 1–4:

1. Ask the user your questions clearly and concisely.
2. Proceed with your stated assumptions and defaults.
3. If the user provides new information, update your understanding and continue.
4. If you discover new gaps, return to Step 2.
