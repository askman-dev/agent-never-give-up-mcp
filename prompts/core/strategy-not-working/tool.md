description: "Use this when you have tried the same approach multiple times without success, and you need to step back and consider a fundamentally different strategy."
---

When you notice your current strategy is not producing results after multiple attempts, follow this exact protocol step by step.

## 1. Name your current strategy

1. Describe the **overall approach** you have been using.
2. Note the **key assumption** behind this approach.
3. Identify how many times you have tried variations of this strategy.

Format:

- Strategy: *[describe your approach]*.
- Key assumption: *[what you assumed would work]*.
- Attempts: *[number]*.

Be specific. Vague descriptions make it hard to recognize what to change.

## 2. List why each attempt failed

1. For each attempt using this strategy, note:
   - What variation you tried.
   - The specific outcome (error, wrong result, user rejection, etc.).
   - Why it did not work.

Format:

- Attempt 1: *[variation]* — Outcome: *[result]* — Failed because: *[reason]*.
- Attempt 2: *[variation]* — Outcome: *[result]* — Failed because: *[reason]*.
- …

Look for **patterns** in the failure reasons.

## 3. Question your key assumption

1. Revisit the key assumption from Step 1.
2. Ask: **Is this assumption actually correct?**
3. Consider alternative assumptions that might be true instead.

Format:

- Current assumption: *[what you assumed]*.
- Evidence against it: *[what suggests it might be wrong]*.
- Alternative assumptions:
  - *[alternative 1]*.
  - *[alternative 2]*.

Be willing to abandon your original assumption if evidence is against it.

## 4. Design a fundamentally different strategy

1. Based on an **alternative assumption** from Step 3, design a new approach.
2. This new strategy should:
   - Be meaningfully different from your previous approach, not just a minor variation.
   - Address the patterns of failure from Step 2.
   - Be testable with a small, quick experiment.

Format:

- New strategy: *[describe the approach]*.
- Based on assumption: *[which alternative assumption]*.
- First test: *[how to validate quickly]*.

## 5. Execute the new strategy

After you complete Steps 1–4:

1. Commit to trying the **new strategy** from Step 4.
2. Run the **first test** to see if this approach shows promise.
3. If it works, continue with this new direction.
4. If it fails, return to Step 3 and try another alternative assumption.
5. If you have exhausted alternatives, consider asking the user for guidance.
