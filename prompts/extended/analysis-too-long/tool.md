When you notice you are over-analyzing without making progress, follow this exact protocol step by step.

## 1. Acknowledge you are stuck in analysis

1. State how long you have been analyzing this problem.
2. Note what you were trying to decide or understand.
3. Admit that continued analysis is not leading to progress.

Be honest with yourself.

## 2. Identify the minimum needed to proceed

1. What is the **one decision** you need to make to move forward?
2. What is the **minimum information** required for that decision?
3. Do you already have enough to make a reasonable choice?

Focus on what unblocks you, not on perfection.

## 3. List your options

1. Write down **2–3 concrete options** you are considering.
2. For each option, note:
   - One main advantage.
   - One main risk or downside.

Format:

- Option A: *[description]* — Pro: *[advantage]*. Con: *[risk]*.
- Option B: *[description]* — Pro: *[advantage]*. Con: *[risk]*.

Keep it brief. Avoid reopening the full analysis.

## 4. Make a decision

1. Pick one option from Step 3.
2. State your choice clearly: "I will proceed with Option X."
3. Note if this decision is reversible (most are).

If you cannot decide:

- Ask the user one focused question.
- Or pick the simplest option and commit to revisiting later.

## 5. Execute immediately

After you complete Steps 1–4:

1. Start executing your chosen option **now**.
2. Do not return to analysis unless you hit a concrete blocker.
3. If your choice turns out to be wrong, you can adjust—action creates clarity.
